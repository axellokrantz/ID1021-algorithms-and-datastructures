# ID1021-Algorithms-and-Datastructures
## Course contents

Basic algorithm analysis:
* Simple numerical algorithms.<br>

Fundamental algorithms:
* Sequential and binary search algorithms.
Fundamental data structures:
* Depth first search and Width first search.
* Sorting algorithms: selection sorting, insertion sorting, Quicksort, heapsort, mergesort.
* Fundamental data structures: Linear lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary tree, heaps, binary search trees and problem trees.<br>

Program Design:
* Design and implementation of programmes that use basic algorithms and data structures to solve computer science problems.

## Intended learning outcomes
On completion of the course, students should be able to

* Describe a number of common algorithms for search and sorting and their properties
compare algorithms with regard to time and memory usage.
* Implement data structures as linear lists stacks, queues, hash tables, binary tree and search trees.
* Identify problems where the data structures above are useful and design simple algorithms with these.
* Write programmes that use algorithms and data structures by means of good programming principles such as systematic tests and abstraction
model problems as search problems and implement algorithms for breadth-first-search, depth-first-search or best-first-search.<br>

in order to

* Be able to design programmes that solve problems by using commonly occurring algorithms and data structures
acquire sufficient prior knowledge to be able to take advanced courses in computer science.
